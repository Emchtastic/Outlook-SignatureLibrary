Creating a JIRA Project:
https://support.atlassian.com/jira-core-cloud/docs/create-a-project/
__While I didn't actually create the JIRA Project for the Scrum Squad, however 
I did look up the process for future reference. This link also details some of
the basic customization for the project.

Adding Users:
https://support.atlassian.com/jira-core-cloud/docs/add-new-users/
__I was tasked with adding all the users when we first started using JIRA, not
complicated other than getting everyone's information.

Permissions:
https://support.atlassian.com/jira-core-cloud/docs/manage-permissions/
__We made all the Users Admins in this case so that everyone could take on any
role needed so we didn't do much with this.

Syncing JIRA to BB:
https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/connect-bitbucket-cloud-to-jira-software-cloud/
__We were never able to get this working, I suspect is has something to do with 
the fact we were using two different accounts (one being mine the other being 
Professor Beaty's, And I don't think the permissions to Sync were ever given to
the team)
