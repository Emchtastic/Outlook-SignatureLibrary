__I was the one who set up the Git Repo with my own account, I believe this was the root of 
our Syncing issues between BB and JIRA.

Setting Merge rules:
https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/pull-request-and-merge-settings/
__I set up these when I created the repo, Making it so that everyone would need an approval 
to merge to dev and 2 approvals to merge to Main. This however prooved to be an issue because
people were able to approve their own merges. I know you can turn this off with full mode but
with student we had to add one each level to make sure you had someone else looking at your
code.
