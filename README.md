# README # Signature Library Outlook Extension

An application that allows outlook users to create and store unique email signatures into a signature library. Users can select or randomly append signatures into the email body. Saves signatures under the user outlook data so the library follows the user on multiple devices. 

Utilized CI/CD pipeline with Bitbucket pipelines. 

Tested with jest.
